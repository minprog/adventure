## Background

Back in the days, before graphics cards were a thing, text-based adventure games were incredibly popular. This type of game consists entirely out of text, and is traversed by commands much like the ones you would enter in the terminal. One such game is Colossal Cave Adventure, created by [William Crowther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crowther_(programmer)) in 1975, that served as the inspiration for the text adventure game genre.

In Adventure you have to navigate between "Rooms" through commands such as "WEST" and "EAST", but also "IN" or "OUT":

    You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
    building. A small stream flows out of the building and
    down a gully to the south. A road runs up a small hill
    to the west.
    > WEST
    You are at the end of a road at the top of a small hill.
    You can see a small building in the valley to the east.
    > EAST
    Outside building.
    >

That first part of the adventure "map" may look like this:

![](map.png){:.w300}

You can find the full map, including a spoiler-free version, [at this website](http://www.spitenet.com/cave/), but note that you will be implementing a portion of the full map!

But there is more than just navigating, at all times you can ask for `HELP` for an explanation of the game, or `LOOK` to get a detailed description of the room you are in.
From the previous example you could see that the second time a room is entered a shorter description was shown. If we were to enter the `LOOK` command we would again see the following:

    > LOOK
    You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
    building. A small stream flows out of the building and
    down a gully to the south. A road runs up a small hill
    to the west.
    >

Besides moving and looking there is also interaction with items. These items are located within rooms and are yours to take and drop (`TAKE <item>`, `DROP <item>`).

Forgot what you've picked up throughout your journey? Using the `INVENTORY` command you get a list of what you're carrying around. Interacting with items would look like this:

    Inside building
    You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
    There is a a set of keys here
    > TAKE keys
    Taken.
    > INVENTORY
    KEYS, a set of keys
    > DROP keys
    Dropped.
    > INVENTORY
    inventory is empty.
    >

A player can use these items to pass otherwise unpassable blockades, such as the "strong steel grate".

For this assignment, the adventure "map" is provided in a few **data files**, that contain room names and description, and in particular, information about which rooms are connected to other rooms, and using which commands.

Though Crowther originally wrote his game in Fortran, an imperative programming language that has been around since the 1950s, we will be taking a more modern approach to its implementation, using object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is particularly suited to Adventure, because its main idea is a series of rooms that are connected. Each room will be an object, and all of these objects will point to each other.


## Specification

Implement an object-oriented version of Crowther's Adventure game using the class structure provided below. It should have the following parts:

1. implement **loading** of the map:
	* handling command line arguments to open a given datafile
	* loading game data into a series of objects
2. implement user **interaction**:
	* prompting the user for commands and execute those
	* warn about non-existent commands
	* moving the player from room to room
3. implement game **logic**:
    * forced movements
    * managing items and inventory

## Understanding

### `data/`

The `data` directory contains data files with which you can create two versions of adventure. `TinyAdv.dat` is the smallest adventure game, consisting of 4 rooms. Here are its contents in full:

    1	Outside building	You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.  A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill to the west.
    2	End of road	You are at the end of a road at the top of a small hill. You can see a small building in the valley to the east.
    3	Inside building	You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
    4	Victory	You have found the hidden well of winning a tiny game. Congratulations!

    1	WEST	2	UP	2	NORTH	3	IN	3
    2	EAST	1	DOWN	1
    3	SOUTH	1	OUT	1	DOWN	4

    KEYS	a set of keys	3
    LAMP	a brightly shining brass lamp	2

The file comprises three parts, divided by two blank lines. The first part describes the "rooms", with on each line an identifying number, then a TAB character, then a short description, then another TAB character, and then a long description:

    1	Outside building	You are standing at the end of ...

The second part describes connections between rooms. In fact, this section defines the "commands" that players can type to navigate from one room to another. Of each line, the first part is a room identifier (the place where the connection starts) and then there are one or more connections, each having a command, then a TAB, and the number of the room it connects to.

    2	EAST	1	DOWN	1

The third and final part describes "objects" that may be found in the game. A line contains first a "command" that can be typed to manipulate the object, then a TAB, then a short description of the object, then a TAB and finally the number of the room that the object will initially be placed in.

Also included in your distribution is `SmallAdv.dat`, which is a bit larger and includes more advanced interactions, as well as `CrowtherAdv.dat`, which is the complete original adventure game!

### `adventure.py`

Take a look at `adventure.py`. The file has three main components.

1. The `import` statement. Instead of working from a single file, we've split our two classes into separate files, in order to keep our files relatively short and tidy. To be able to access the Room class from the `adventure.py` file, we use `import`.

2. The biggest part of the file is the `Adventure` class, which contain all methods that make the game work.
	
	- The `__init__` method ensures that all is set for playing an adventure game. In particular, it uses the other methods to load game data, build a structure of rooms, and point `current_room` to the first room in the map.

	- The `load_rooms` method opens and parses the data files, and creates `Room` objects with that data. We'll explain more in step 1, below.

	- Moving around in the game is handled by the `move` method, by setting the "current" room to a different one.

	- The `get_description` method provides the description of the current room, the room the player is in.

3. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` part, which contains the main "game loop" of the program. After introducing the game, it repeatedly asks for a command from the user, and tries to perform that command. 

> A hard constraint in this program is that the `Adventure` class may not `print` anything. All other printing should be done in the `__main__` part. And in return, the `__main__` part may, aside from printing things, only call methods in the `Adventure` class. It may not access methods and/or attributes from the `Room class`. Each class will have separate responsibilities.

## Step 0: Implement the Room class

The first step in building the game is creating a class that describes "Room" objects. The objects of this class will have two main responsibilities:

1. Storing information about one room; in particular its ID, short description and long description. These are stored in a few object variables.

2. Storing information about the connections to other rooms, and the commands typed to go there. These should ideally be stored in a dictionary.

To store information about the room itself, implement a basic data class. Create a file called `room.py`, with a class called `Room`. The initializer should accept and store:

- room ID (integer)
- room name (string)
- room description (string)

> Tip: do not use `id` as a variable name. This is a Python keyword which already has a particular meaning. So instead, use something like `room_id` or `ident`.

To store information about the connections, you will need to create a new empty dictionary in the initializer. After loading the game map, a connections dictionary inside a `Room` object might look like this:

	connections = {
		"WEST": <room.Room object at 0x7f325cbc4d68>,
		"EAST": <room.Room object at 0x7f325cbc4fd0>
	}

This means that the dictionary maps a **direction** (string) to another `Room` object. This is very important! The description above means that `Room` objects will point to each other, meaning that when the game map is loaded, a [**graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is created of rooms and connections. The goal of the game is to *navigate that graph*. A graph, incidentally, is one kind of Abstract Data Type!

For example, if we load the **Tiny** game map, the result should be that we have 4 objects in memory, all pointing to each other:

![](tiny.png)

Then you need to add three methods for managing and looking up connections:

- `add_connection` which accepts a direction (string) and a room (another Room object), and stores those in the dictionary
- `has_connection` which accepts a direction (string), and checks whether there is a connection in the dictionary under that name
- `get_connection` which accepts a direction (string), and retrieves the actual Room object that it connects to

Now, implement the three methods for managing connections. You might need to read up on [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries).

> A hard constraint in this program is that the `Room` class may not access (use) other classes. Its methods may only manipulate `self` and any access only objects that are passed to it as arguments to method calls.

After implementing, you should test the class by starting Python and creating `Room` objects:

	$ python -i room.py
	>>> r1 = Room(1, "Room 1", "Description 1")
	>>> r2 = Room(2, "Room 2", "Description 2")
	>>> r2.add_connection("WEST", r1)
	>>> r2.has_connection("EAST")
	False
	>>> r2.has_connection("WEST")
	True
	>>> r2.get_connection("WEST")
	<__main__.Room object at 0x7f36f65076a0>

In that last line, you find the Python description of a `Room` object, along with its assigned memory address. Seems to work! (The address on your computer will most likely be different.)

**Be sure to test manually before continuing!**


## Step 1: Reading data files and the code

Take another look at the data in `TinyAdv.dat`. **Parsing** is the task of loading this information into memory in a useful way. For this version of adventure, you are going to read the room information (the first section of the file) as well as the connections information (the second section of the file). We'll leave the third section, with game objects, for another time.

As it happens, the way the data is structured makes it easier to use it. We need to implement parsing in two **phases**: first create all rooms, then make all connections (think about why this is essential!).

### A small intermezzo on reading files

You may have seen that it's possible to load information from a file using a `for`-loop:

    for line in file:
        # do something for each line

However, in this assignment, we can't easily use this idea, because there are several sections in the datafile and each section has a different structure.

What we can do is write our own loops that read lines for one section each. We then read only a single line of the file per iteration. This is done using the `readline()` method. Here's an example for opening a file and reading two lines:

    with open("TinyAdv.dat") as f:
        for i in range(2):
            line = f.readline()
        print(line)

As you might imagine, this short piece of code will print something like `2	End of road...` etc.

Important to note is that when using `readline()`, the string it returns will usually end in a newline character. In fact, there are three main options:

- a line containing text, ending in a newline character
- an empty line, for which `readline` returns just the newline character (`"\n"`)
- the end of the file, for which `readline` returns an empty string (`""`)

By making use of this particular behavior of `readline` we can parse section by section of our datafile.

### Phase 1: creating rooms

Now implement the first phase of `load_rooms` in `adventure.py`. Start with the file:

    with open(filename) as f:

Then write a loop to read the room data:

1. read one line into a string
2. `split()` it into a list, making sure you split on the TAB character ("\t")
3. create a new room object using the data from the list
4. add the room to `self.rooms` for later use, mapping the room ID to the room object itself
5. go to 1

Make sure the loop ends as soon as `readline` returns *just* a newline character (think well about designing your loop!). Also, don't forget to clean the data. Each line has a newline character at the end, and this character should *not* end up in the room object description! Recall from lecture how to remove a stray newline from the end of a string?

Having done the above should lead to a fully initialized `self.rooms` dictionary:

	self.rooms = {
		1: <room.Room object at 0x7f325cbc4d68>,
		2: <room.Room object at 0x7f325cbc4fd0>
	}

Finally, below that code, add a few assertions you know to be *always* true:

    assert 1 in self.rooms
    assert self.rooms[1].name == "Outside building"

(We know this is *always* true in the sense that all three data files that we provide conform to these assertions.)

You can then run `adventure.py` and make sure none of the assertions fail. (You should probably at some point remove any assertions that depend on particular descriptions, because your program may be used using a different data file!)


### Phase 2: making connections

Because all rooms have now been created, we can read the connection data from the same file and make the actual connections between the rooms.

We leave designing the loop up to you, but remember that each line starts with the room number that the connection starts from, and that each line may contain *multiple* other rooms to connect to. This is good moment to take out pen and paper and design the algorithm!

To actually connect rooms, you will have to look them up in `self.rooms` by number, and then make a connection:

    source_room = self.rooms[1]
    destination_room = self.rooms[2]
    source_room.add_connection("WEST", destination_room)

When finished, add a few assertions that should be true after making connections.

    assert self.rooms[1].has_connection("WEST")
    assert self.rooms[2].get_connection("EAST").name == "Outside building"

You can again run `adventure.py` and make sure none of the assertions fail.

(Note that in a later step, you'll add code for reading the objects.)

## Step 2: Moving around

Now that we have a couple of rooms, we can start implementing the game itself. We'll start by implementing a `move` method for the `Adventure` class. This methods defines an action in the game. Then, we'll write code for the game loop, where a player can actually enter commands, after which the game loop will call upon the methods of an `Adventure` object.

### Implement `move`

The most basic function of this game is moving around between rooms. Remember that the `Adventure` class has a variable that keeps track of the "current room" for the game. It also has a still-empty `move` method that's supposed to set the current room to a new one.

The `move` method has one parameter, `direction`, which should let you lookup (via the `current_room`) which room we're going to move on to. Just set `current_room` to that room and you're done.

`move` should also return a boolean `True` or `False` depending on whether the move was possible. The main program can use this result to notify the user if the move could not be performed.


### Prompting for commands

Now check out `if __name__ == '__main__'` at the bottom of `adventure.py`. Currently, if you run `adventure.py`, you will be shown the description of the first room, you can even enter commands, but nothing will happen as you enter them.

We're going to support a few different commands, but first of all, let's allow your use to move around in the game using directions like "IN" or "WEST".

- Start by passing the entered `command` to the adventure class's `move` method.

- Modify the program to display the room description after each command, so it feels like moving around in the map. (Currently a description is only printed once, at the start of the game.)

- Following the description we'll again prompt the player for a command. The '>' will mark this prompt. It should look like this:

		You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
		building.  A small stream flows out of the building and
		down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill
		to the west.
		>

- Not all users read the docs! Be sure to allow for both UPPER and lower case directions.

- If the player attempts a command that cannot be executed tell them they attempted an "Invalid command." and prompt for another command using the '>'.

		> OUT
		Invalid command.
		>


## Step 3: Short and long descriptions

If a player enters a room they've already seen, only give them the short description. How should we keep track of that?

- First, add a new attribute to `Room.__init__`: self.visited. It should be `False` when the room is first initialized.

- Then, add a `set_visited()` method to `Room`, which marks it as visited. Also, add a `is_visited()` method, which returns False or True depending on the current state of the room.

- Having done that, you can change `Adventure`'s `move` method to set a room to visited **right before moving to another room**. Use the new `set_visited` method to do that.

- And finally, you can now use `is_visited()` in `Adventure.get_description` to return either the room `name` or the room `description`, depending on whether it was visited before.


## Step 4: Additional commands

As a final step for making the basic game work, we'll add a few commands that make it easier to use: `QUIT`, `HELP` and `LOOK`. Implement these in the following way:

-   `HELP` prints instructions to remind the player of their commands and how to use them. It should behave as follows:

        > HELP
        You can move by typing directions such as EAST/WEST/IN/OUT
        QUIT quits the game.
        HELP prints instructions for the game.
        INVENTORY lists the item in your inventory.
        LOOK lists the complete description of the room and its contents.
        TAKE <item> take item from the room.
        DROP <item> drop item from your inventory.

-   `LOOK` prints a full description of the room the player is currently in, even if the room was visited earlier.

        Inside building
        > LOOK
        You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
        KEYS: a set of keys
        WATER: a bottle of water

For the latter, should implement a method `get_long_description` in `Adventure`, which will always return the long description.


## Step 5: Implement BACK

Sometimes you make a mistake in playing Adventure and you'd like to go BACK. This is not always easy. We will provide a "secret" command that will take the player back to the previous room.

This is one feature that is also known as the "Undo" command in various other programs. The approach that we will take here is save references to all rooms that we pass and when asked to go BACK, we take the previous room and move there.

To implement this, you must make a class called `History`, which will behave quite like a *stack ADT*. You can push a room onto it, and you can retrieve the previous room. It doesn't have to do much more!

So create this class and mack the `BACK` command work. Tip: everytime a room is *left* for another room, push the room to history.


## Step 6: Try a larger map

Before continuing, make sure your program still works if you transition from the **Tiny** map to the **Small** map! From now on, when testing, run the game like this:

    $ python adventure.py Small


## Step 7: Forced movement

Sometimes a player will attempt a movement they cannot make. For example, in the Small adventure, when going WEST from the "Outside grate" room (6), one finds oneself at the edge of an "unpassable stream". The only way is going back the "Outside grate" room.

The adventure game has a special feature called `FORCED` movements. If a player enters a room that has a direction named `FORCED`, the full room description will be printed, but then the player will be immediately moved back to the connected room. After moving back, the connected room should print the short description, as usual for a room that has already been visited.

- You'll most likely want to do a check each time you move to a new room. If there's a `FORCED` connection in the new room, take a good look around and follow the forced route.

- As you're going to have to print the description, handle this in the main game loop and not in the `move` method! To accomplish this, you have to add a new method to the `Adventure` class:

    - `is_forced` will allow us to check if the current room has a forced connection

    - note that you can use the existing `get_long_description`!

- Make sure that forced movement does not interact with the `BACK` command. E.g., when you go from room 1 to room 2, but are then forced into room 3, the `BACK` command should take you to room 1 again!


## Step 8: Adding "objects"

Now that you are sure the game is playable using the Tiny and Small maps, let's implement the remaining feature needed to be able to play the Crowther map as well. As seen above, the data file contains descriptions for objects that are placed in the game (each in a default room) and then picked up, taken along, and dropped again by the player. The Crowther game is designed in a way that some routes can only be taken when the player is carrying certain objects.

Seeing items in the game should look like this:

    You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
    KEYS: a set of keys
    WATER: a bottle of water

Picking up items should work like this:

    You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
    KEYS: a set of keys
    WATER: a bottle of water
    > TAKE KEYS
    KEYS taken.
    > TAKE KEYS
    No such item.
    > TAKE SOMETHING
    No such item.
    >

Putting down items should work like this:

    You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
    KEYS: a set of keys
    WATER: a bottle of water
    > TAKE KEYS
    KEYS taken.
    > DROP KEYS
    KEYS dropped.
    > DROP KEYS
    No such item.
    > TAKE KEYS
    KEYS taken.

Listing whay you have should look like this:

    > INVENTORY
    KEYS: a set of keys
    LAMP: a brightly shining brass lamp

To do this:

- You must implement a new `Item` class that represents objects within the game (it should be obvious that it would not be advisable to name a class `Object`, hence the alternative that we propose here). Place it in its own file `item.py`.

- Then you should add variables such that each `Room` object can "contain" or point to several `Item` objects. And, because a game item cannot only reside in a given room, but also be picked up and kept by the player, you should also create a place in the `Adventure` class to contain `Item` objects.

- Then you need to make sure objects are loaded from the data file and place into the correct initial rooms after loading.

- And finally, you can implement user interface code for items, in particular by modifying the `LOOK` command and implementing `TAKE` and `DROP` commands. But, note that you should always call methods on the `Adventure` class to do these actions! Do not directly manipulate elements (variables) from that class or from other classes.

And to test, don't forget to load the Crowther map:

    $ python adventure.py Crowther


## Step 9: Conditional movement

Having objects in possession can allow your player to move to different rooms than without those objects, which opens up possibilities not seen before (like winning!). This is encoded in the Crowther data file. For example, room 9 has the following connections:

    9	EAST	8	WEST	12/LAMP	WEST	10

The east and west exit each connect, in normal conditions, to rooms 8 and 10, respectively. However, when holding a lamp, the behaviour of the "WEST" command is changed, moving the player into room 12.

As you can see, you will need to change your code for reading the data files a bit. Then you'll also need to make changes to your `Room` class, the `Adventure` class and the main game loop!


## Step 10: Synonyms

Finally, implement Synonyms. Note that your adventure game does not implement all commands in the synonyms data file! Implement it in such a way that everything still works as expected! In this case, it's advisable to not write a full class to manage synonyms, but use a standard dictionary instead. We can do this because the synonyms are not really part of the game itself, but more of the user interface for the game.


## Step 11: Check your work

Have a good look at the constraints we **noted earlier**:

- A hard constraint in this program is that the `Room` class may not access (use) other classes. Its methods may only manipulate `self` and any access only objects that are passed to it as arguments to method calls.

- A hard constraint in this program is that the `Adventure` class may not `print` anything. And in return, the `__main__` part may, aside from printing things, only call methods in the `Adventure` class. It may not ever directly access methods and/or attributes from the `Room class`!

- Remember that only a few things work with the Tiny map. You should normally test the game using the Crowther map. `check50` will certainly do so!

- If you need help testing "winning" the game, this [solution](win.txt) (spoiler alert!) may come in handy.

- Use our checks:

    check50 -l minprog/adventure/2022/more
